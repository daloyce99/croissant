System Updates:

Hide the Dashboard, Performance, and Satisfaction tabs for now, since data is currently shared via Looker.

Rename the Settings tab to Leader Voice.

Rename Notification Email to Master Email Address.
/ostead of providing a survey frequency option, implement fields for Time and Date.

Update the login page to require Master Email Address and Access Code.

The output fields from the system should be:
[popup_text, popup_type, time, date]

UI-wise this looks fine to start with. Just a couple of changes:

Use colors #F2F2F2 and #FFFFFF as the color scheme.

Use Nunito font throughout.

The Save Settings button should have less rounded corners — about a border radius of 25 (similar to Canva’s style), more like a square with softened edges.
